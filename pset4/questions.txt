0.  How many colors does each format support?
        BMP: 24 bits per pixel are common for BMP files, which supports 2^24 = 16,777,216 colors. 64 bits per pixel is also possible.
        GIF: Store 8 bits at most, so 256 colors.
        JPEG: JPEG images store 24 bits per pixel, so >16 million colors.
        PNG: PNG can store colors with up to 48 bits per pixel, so 2^48 colors.
1.  GIF supports animation.
2.  Lossless compression = every single bit of data that was originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed.
    Lossy compression = the file is reduced by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information.
3.  JPEG is lossy compressed.
4.  When the operating system erases a FAT file, 1) the system modifies the filename's first character in the file's directory entry to signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled and 2) the system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters (the actual file data is never touched).
5.  To ensure deleted files cannot be recovered, the options are: 1) destroy the drive, 2) degauss the drive (playing with the magnetism), 3) overwrite the files in a specific way.
6.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library that allows programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, along with the defined min and max values for each type, using macros.
7.  These are unsigned and signed integer types from stdint.h. Using well-defined types makes the code far easier and safer to port since you won't get any surprises when one machine interprets int as 16-bit and another as 32-bit. What you type is what you get when you use them.
8.  1 byte in a BYTE, 4 bytes in a DWORD and also in a LONG (32 bits), and 2 bytes in a WORD (16 bits).
9.  The first two bytes of any BMP file must contain ASCII B then ASCII M.
10. bfSize is the size of the bmp file. biSize is the size of the structure. Both in bytes.
11. If biHeight is postive, the image is bottom up. If biHeight is negative, the image is bottom down. 
12. biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth - the number of bits per pixel.
13. fopen might return a NULL pointer if the file that fopen is trying to write to doesn't exist.
14. fread's third argument is always 1 because we are iterating over every pixel.
15. If biWidth is 3, int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4 = 3.
16. fseek allows us to change the offset of a pointer.
17. SEEK_CUR is the current location of the pointer before the offset is applied.
